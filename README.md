## The problem Cardify solves
Students devote a significant amount of time acquiring new information that will enable them to solve problems in the future. However, 80% of what they learn is forgotten after three days. Spaced Repetition is a learning method used in order to help students remember concepts for a longer period of time. This method is extremely effective in helping people learn a foreign language or remember complicated information, yet it isn't used all too often because it is an unconventional habit to form, and most people believe they will be able to recall the concept they studied now whenever they require it.

Cardify the concept of Spaced Repetition to help students remember what they have learned for the rest of their lives. It will help them recall concepts in as little as 10 minutes per day. We provide a user-friendly interface for students to facilitate the process to enable them to cultivate this habit.
